### Package functions:

We will be implementing two stepwise feature selection techniques:
- `forward_selection`: a feature selection method in which you start with a null model and iteratively add useful features 
- `backward_selection`: a feature selection method in which you start with a full model and iteratively remove the least useful feature at each step

We will also be implementing metrics that evaluate model performance: 
- `AIC`: computes the Akaike information criterion [Akaike information criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion)
- `BIC`: computes the [Bayesian information criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion)
