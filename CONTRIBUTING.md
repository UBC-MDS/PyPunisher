### 2. Core Contributors

- All contributors should work locally and push into their *own-dev* branch.

- When a contributor wants to merge with the *master* branch, they should create a pull request and assign it to a fellow contributor for verifying.

- The user who created the pull request should not merge the request with the *master* branch.
