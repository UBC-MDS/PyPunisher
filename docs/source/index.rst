Welcome to PyPunisher.


PyPunisher is a package for feature and model selection in Python.
Specifically, this package has implemented tools for forward and backward model
selection (see `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression/>`_).
In order to measure model quality during the selection procedures, we have also implemented the
Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion (see below), both of which punish complex
models -- hence this package's name.
